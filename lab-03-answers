(c) Training MSE: 1.5350956362420822
(d) Test MSE: 1.7543308610948438
(e) Your answer: The test MSE is smaller than the variance of y_test. This means that our model is able to explain some of the variance in the data, so it is better than just predicting the mean every time.

(c2) Best MSE: 1.1942865460094283
(d) Time: 45.2 seconds
(f) test MSE: 1.2398437245052845 
(g) Your answer: Yes, compared to the linear regression model in (2), the KNN model with optimized hyperparameters has a lower test MSE (1.2398 vs. 1.7543). This indicates that the KNN model is better at capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

(c1) Best hyperparameters: 
* strategy: median
* poly degree: 2
* n neighbors: 40
* weight: distance
(c2) Best MSE: 1.4213703346746598
(d) Time: 2.0 seconds
(f) test MSE: 1.2989312431187976
(g) Your answer: The Randomized Grid Search was not quite as effective as the full Grid Search in finding the optimal hyperparameters, as evidenced by the slightly higher test MSE (1.2989 vs. 1.2398). However, it was significantly faster (2.0 seconds vs. 45.2 seconds), making it a more efficient choice when computational resources or time are limited.
(h) Your answer: The Grid Search method is more thorough and can potentially find better hyperparameters, leading to a lower test MSE. However, it is also much more computationally expensive and time-consuming. The Randomized Grid Search, while slightly less effective in this case, provides a good balance between performance and efficiency, making it a practical choice for larger datasets or when quick results are needed.
